#### `context_id`
Tasks and events are shown on the main interface of Sudowudo and paged. The `context_id` allows you to modify tasks and events that are shown on the interface based on the *contextual* identifier, i.e. the numerical index that is shown on the interface. The identifier does not need to be enclosed in quote marks.

The `context_id` is not persistent and can change depending on what tasks/events are on the interface at the time. It is meant to provide a more convenient and interactive way to interact with tasks/events.

### Updating an Event
#### Editing Event Details
Sometimes it is necessary to change the details of your event because life. Luckily, you can edit an item's description, start date/time and end date/time.

```bash
# format
edit CONTEXT_ID FIELD_NAME:NEW_DETAIL
```
Fields: [`CONTEXT_ID`](#context-id), [`FIELD_NAME`](#field-name), `NEW_DETAIL`

You can change multiple fields for the same event at the same time by separating multiple `FIELD_NAME:NEW_DETAIL` parameters with a comma.

```bash
# examples
edit 10 by: 29 October 5pm
edit 4 end:1/2/2016 10:51am # edits the forth item currently listed
edit 5 period : 11 nov 4:30pm to 6:30pm

# change multiple fields at the same time
# both of these commands are equivalent
edit 1 start: this friday 1600, end:this friday 1645
edit 1 period: this friday 1600 to 1645
```
