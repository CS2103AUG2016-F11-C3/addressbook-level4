#### `datetime`
Dates and times are expressed together ("datetime") and have a natural format.

Do not put commas in the `datetime` parameter!

##### Examples of `datetime`
```bash
# for a period of time
5 sept at 5pm to 6 sept at 6pm
fifth november at 2130
this wednesday 6pm to this saturday 7pm
12/12/2016 9am to 25/12 1600

# for a recurring period of time
every monday 9-10am

# for a deadline
by 12/12/2016 at 1pm

# for a recurring deadline
every friday at 11:30pm
```

### `field_name`
The field names denote specific parts of a task/event.

The available field names:

| `field_name` | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| `name`       | [descriptor](#descriptors) | Task/event name |
| `tag`       | [tag](#tags) | Task/event tag |
| `start`      | [datetime](#datetime) | Start datetime |
| `end`        | [datetime](#datetime) | End datetime |
| `period`     | [datetime](#datetime) | Start and end datetime |
| `by`         | [datetime](#datetime) | Deadline datetime |

### Notes on Syntax Examples
In the remainder of this section, note the following:

1. Fields that are in uppercase are *user parameters*.
2. The order of parameters in command formats is fixed.
3. Commands that begin with `for` have autocomplete to assist the user.


### Adding an Event
#### Start and End Times
For an event with a definite start and end time, you can use the following syntax to add this event.

```bash
# format
add EVENT_NAME from DATETIME #optional #tags
```

Fields: [`EVENT_NAME`](#descriptors), [`DATETIME`](#datetime), [`TAG(S)`](#tags)

```bash
# examples
add "Do laundry" from 1600 to 1700 #chores
add "CS2103 Hackathon" from 1000 on 12 November to 1200 on 15 November      # multiday event
add "Attempt tutorial" from 12/12/2016 9:30pm to 10:30pm #optional #tags    # multiple tags
add "Go to school" from 1800 fifth january till the sixth october at 9:30pm
```

#### Deadlines
For a task with no definite start time but a definite end time (e.g. a homework assignment), you can use the following syntax.

```bash
# format
add TASK_NAME by DATETIME #optional #tags
```

Fields: [`TASK_NAME`](#descriptors), [`DATETIME`](#datetime), [`TAG(S)`](#tags)

```bash
# examples
add "CS2103 Tutorial 6" by 7 October
add "CS2103 Peer Feedback" by 2359h 27 Sep
add "Walk dog" by 9:41pm
add "Perform magic tricks" by two weeks from now #job
```

#### Floating Tasks
Floating tasks do not have a definite start or end time.

```bash
# format
add TASK_NAME #optional #tags
```
Fields: [`TASK_NAME`](#descriptors), [`TAG(S)`](#tags)

```bash
# examples
add "Schedule CS2103 Consult" 
```
```

### Deleting a Task/Event
You can delete an event using its name. This is not the same as marking an event as complete (see [Marking as Complete](#marking-as-complete)), as it removes the task/event from the record.

```bash
# format
delete CONTEXT_ID
```

Field: [`CONTEXT_ID`](#context-id)

```bash
# examples
delete 9 # deletes the ninth item displayed
delete 241 # delete the item with event ID 241
```
```
