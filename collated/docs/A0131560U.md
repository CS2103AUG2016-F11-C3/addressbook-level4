## Appendix B: Use Cases
(For all use cases below, the `System` is Wudodo and the `Actor` is the user, unless specified otherwise)

### Use case: Add task
#### MSS
1. User inputs task details
2. System stores task details in database

#### Extensions
1a. User inputs details in incorrect format
> System displays error message and help text
> Use case resumes at step 1

### Use case: Find  task
#### MSS
1. User inputs search string
2. System shows matching tasks
(Use case ends)

#### Extensions
1a. User inputs invalid search string
> System displays errors message
> Use case resumes at step 1

2a. No matching tasks
> Use case ends
```

## Appendix D: Product Survey

### Desired features
This list of features is taken from the [Handbook](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/contents/handbook.html#handbook-project-product).

1. Command line-based UI
2. Take in events with specified start and end time
2. Block out multiple tentative start/end times for an event
2. Take in events with deadlines but no specified start/end time
3. Take in floating tasks  without user-specified start end times
5. Mark items as done
4. Track uncompleted to-do items past end time
5. Quick-add events
6. Access to-do list without internet connection
7. Easily choose which to-do item to do next
8. Keyword search
8. Specify data storage location

### Todoist

#### Meets Specifications
- Setting deadlines allowed
- Floating tasks allowed
- Can easily mark items as done by clicking on them
- Keeps track of uncompleted deadlines in chronological order
- Natural language quick-add function gives flexibility when adding to-do items

#### `tags`
Tags are single-word markers that can be added to a task. Each task can have as many `tags` as you want. Hashtags are used to denote a tag.

```java
#important   // valid
important    // invalid
```

```

### Searching for a Task/Event
You can search for specific events using keyphrases. Keyphrases are filtered according to whether they search through `Descriptor`s, `Tag`s or `DateTime`s. Take note of your current [`list`](#enumerating-tasks) context, as this will affect what items are searched.

The keyphrases are case-insensitive and can be simply part of the event name. All of the keyphrases must be matched for an item to be returned.

```java
// format
find "DESCRIPTOR KEYPHRASE" "KEYPHRASE" // searches descriptors for partial matches
find #TAGPHRASE                         // searches tags for partial matches
find from tomorrow to tuesday           // searches for exact matches to the date specified
```

Fields: [`DESCRIPTOR KEYPHRASE`](#descriptors), [`TAG KEYWORD`](#tags), [`DATETIME KEYPHRASE`](#datetime)

```java
// examples
find "cake"
find "CS2103" #homework tomorrow        // searches for CS2103 in descriptors, homework in tags,
                                        // and looks for dates matching the date of 'tomorrow'
```

### Enumerating Tasks
You can enumerate a list of all the events and show it on the main interface. You can also limit your listings using specific meta-tags. List changes the context of your current window view, so that all future searches will occur within this context. For instance, `list task` -> `find "homework"` returns all tasks with the keyword 'homework' in the descriptions, but will not return any events with the keyword 'homework' in the description.

```java
list         // lists all tasks/events in chronological order
list task    // lists all tasks, no events
list event   // lists all events, no tasks
list done    // lists all tasks/events that are done
list undone  // opposite of list done, lists everything not done
list overdue // lists all events/tasks with end date before the current time
```
```
