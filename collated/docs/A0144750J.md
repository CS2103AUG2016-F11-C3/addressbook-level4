## Quick Start

In the following sections, we outline the format of commands to use `Sudowudo`. Tags such as `date` are placeholders in the command syntax and denoted as *fields*.

### Getting Help
`Sudowudo` also stores documentation that can be accessed from its command-line interface using the following command.

```java
// format
help           // for general how-to-use help
help COMMAND   // for command-specific help
```

```java
// examples
help add       // command-specific help for add
help list      // command-specific help for list
```
### Field Formats

#### `descriptors`
Descriptors are words/phrases used for identification, such as for the name of an event or for an event's description. Quote marks are used to denote a descriptor.

```java
"Dental Appointment" // valid
Dental Appointment   // invalid
```
```
