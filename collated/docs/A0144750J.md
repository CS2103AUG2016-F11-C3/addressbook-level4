## Quick Start
<!-- for getting the thing to actually work -->
<!-- need to wait on our refactoring for addressbook-level4 -->
1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed.
2. Download the latest `sudowudo.jar` from the releases tab.
3. Run `sudowudo.jar`

## Features
<!-- each individual command -->
In the following sections, we outline the format of commands to use `Sudowudo`. Tags such as `date` are placeholders in the command syntax and denoted as *fields*.

### Getting Help
`Sudowudo` also stores documentation that can be accessed from its command-line interface using the following command.

```bash
# format
help           # for general how-to-use help
help COMMAND   # for command-specific help
```

```bash
# examples
help add       # command-specific help for add
help list       # command-specific help for list
```
### Field Formats

#### `descriptors`
Descriptors are words/phrases used for identification, such as for the name of an event or for an event's description. Quote marks are used to denote a descriptor.

```bash
"Dental Appointment" # valid
Dental Appointment   # invalid
```
```
